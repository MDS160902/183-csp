### Broken Access Control
#### Description
In Web Apps there are often different kind of groups who have different kind of Access Permissions on Data or parts of the application. Such as „admins“, „normal users“ or „audits“.  A „normal user“ is not allowed to login as an admin and doesn’t has the same permissions as an admin.
