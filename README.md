### Broken Access Control
#### Description
In Web Apps there are often different kind of groups who have different kind of Access Permissions on Data or parts of the application. Such as „admins“, „normal users“ or „audits“.  A „normal user“ is not allowed to login as an admin and doesn’t has the same permissions as an admin.

#### What could work?
If a user has a URL from an admin page, he could theoretically reach the page without having to identify himself, if there is no Access Control
#### What did work?
Nothing! We have an Build Access Control - We test if a user has admin rights. We could on top of that use the Principle of least privilege.
