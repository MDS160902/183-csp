### Software and Data Integrity Failures
#### Description
Insecure Deserialization vulnerability covers software and data integrity issues. This issue can happen when the identity of the apps or data is not checked or verification process is not well-rounded (that is, it can be bypassed or validation failure still lets the app to run) The Fix: Always ensure that the app you are using is trusted and uses sane security practices.

### Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
#### Description
There is no direct vulnerability that can arise due to these issues but in general, logging and monitoring are quite critical. Logging and monitoring is critical and their absence or failures can directly impact visibility, incident alerting, and forensics. These are some of the actionable measures you must take to avoid these issues.

### Server-Side Request Forgery
#### Description
If an attacker can make the server issue (typically) HTTP requests on it’s behalf, then that's SSRF. An attacker can get access to internal services or external services to access or send confidential stuff like AWS temporary credentials assigned to EC2 instances.
